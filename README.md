## 🌐 Why Vanilla JavaScript?

This project was built using vanilla JavaScript to strengthen core programming concepts and deepen understanding of JavaScript’s underlying principles. By avoiding frameworks, the project focuses on mastering JavaScript essentials, which provides versatility and adaptability for future development with different frameworks.

### Leveraging Core Concepts in Frameworks

By understanding vanilla JavaScript fundamentals, developers can leverage frameworks like React more effectively. Knowledge of core JavaScript principles allows easier adaptation to React’s component-based architecture, virtual DOM, and state management. This foundational mastery makes building robust, maintainable applications simpler and more efficient.
